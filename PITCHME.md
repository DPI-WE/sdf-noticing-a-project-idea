# Noticing a Project Idea ü§î

---

- Your proposal should answer 2 questions:
    1. What pain point do you want to address?
    2. How do you plan to solve it?
- Remember, the verb you want to be using with respect to ideas is *not* "think up" but "notice." https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html

- I recommend watching this video on [How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th8JoIan4dg)
- In this video Jared talks about some key questions to ask about any startup idea

---

# Are you the right person to solve this?
- Is this a field you have an expertise or insight?
- Think about your previous experiences and work. You may be uniquely suited to identify, understand, and solve a problem.

---

# How big is the market?
- Do a lot of people have this problem?
- More is better. 
<!-- pricing -->
<!-- difficuly in finding users / customers -->

---

# How acute is the problem?
- Is it really painful and/or annoying?
- How often do people encounter this problem?
    - daily/weekly/monthly/yearly
    - more often is better

<!-- eg uber: I need to get places multiple times a day -->
<!-- buying a house: once a lifetime maybe? -->

---

# Do you have competition?
- This might be a good sign!
- Competition *might* validate that this is a real problem.

---
# Do you want this?
- You'll already have a first user... you!
- Are there a lot of other people like you?

---

# Did this recently become possible or necessary?
- Has something about the world changed recently?
- New technology, law, problem, etc.

---
# Is this an idea you'd want to work on for years?
- Are you passionate about this problem?
- Do you have a personal connection?
- Do you like your user?

---

# Is this a good idea space?
- A good idea space means there are a lot of people with this problem willing to try your solution (and pay for it)
- Your first MVP (minimum viable product) will probably be wrong
- You will learn a lot by getting feedback from your users
- If you're in a good idea space (high potential for success) you can iterate towards the optimal solution

---

Generally, building something you find interesting or in a field you have an expertise or insight is a good start!

---

Jared also talks about some ways to come up with ideas:

- What are you good at?
- Is there a problem you've personally encountered you can build a solution for?
- Is there something you just wish existed?
- Is there something about the world that has changed recently that has created an opportunity?
- Go out and talk to people! ([User Feedback üó£Ô∏è](https://github.com/DPI-WE/user-feedback))
- Is there a big industry that seems broken?

---

- Remember, we're just building fun learning projects. I don't expect you to change the world,... yet. üòÖ

---

- I recommend you start writing down ideas you notice organically and rank them on these key questions.
- Something like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jrgdMMt33lIGqXTEu8vE2fwLjoMkzyJAPlZuKLihvuQ/edit#gid=0) (thanks Thierry!)
